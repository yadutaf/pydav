# Description

This project is a fork from SourceForge project http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-webdav/. It aims to implement a basic but fully functional Python client-side implementation of the WebDav protocol. I sadly was not able to find any decent one. Most clients for "Cloud" storage are now embedding their own version of the client making it pretty hard to interract wit projects such as OwnCloud.
